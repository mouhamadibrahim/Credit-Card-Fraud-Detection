# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project is a step by step process of building a credit card fraud detection algorithm using the credit card fraud detection dataset from kaggle.com. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression. During model building I used data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, decision trees, k nearest neighbor,logistic regression,SVM classifier,random forrest, XGBoost with the accuracy and F1 score for every algorithm

Python Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning Matplotlib for data visualization Sklearn for model building Jupyter notebook.
